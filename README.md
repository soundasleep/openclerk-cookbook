openclerk Cookbook
==================

This cookbook allows one to install [Openclerk](http://openclerk.org) on a Chef client, based on the [Openclerk installation instructions](https://github.com/soundasleep/openclerk/blob/master/INSTALL.md):

### Completed

* Install and configure apache
* Install and configure PHP
* Install and configure mysql
* Download latest Openclerk source code
* Set up Apache vhost
* Install and configure Composer
* Install and configure Grunt
* Install Ruby and sass (for CSS building)
* Build application with `grunt build`
* Update .htaccess
* Initialise MySQL database
* Setup default cron jobs

### TODO

* Upgrade to Chef 12+: getting error message `Error executing action `create` on resource 'mysql_service[default]'`
* Allow `config` templates to be loaded from an external SVN/Git repository (e.g. templates, images)
* Use Capistrano for deployment/config/installing gems instead of [homegrown solution](https://github.com/soundasleep/chef_bundler)
* Allow databases to be upgraded automatically with new releases (depends on [#115](http://redmine.jevon.org/issues/115)) - currently the database is only installed once

See also [openclerk-chef](https://github.com/soundasleep/openclerk-chef) which provides a complete Chef repository and installation instructions that use this cookbook directly.
